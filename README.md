# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project implements and compares three machine learning models to predict the survival of Titanic passengers.


## Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Neural Network (TensorFlow/Keras)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Debendra62/TitanicPassangers.git

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
    run all the cells of notebooks folder python file
    

Results

The performance metrics for each model are saved in the images folder. A visualization of the comparison is available in the notebooks folder.
